# IC-0922
These are small scripts and programs developed to complete assignments in the IC0922 Hydraulic Engineering II course in the University of Costa Rica.

* The "Channels" folder contains a macro-enabled Excel workbook where functions for calculating normal and critical depth in trapezoidal and circular channels have been implemented. The solution method is Newton-Raphson and Secant respectively. The Python file contains those same functions only as code.
* The "Oscilation Tank" folder contains Matlab functions used to simulate the oscillation tank in a forced pipeline of a hydropower project. It was used to calculate the maximum rise in the water level of the tank generated by an abrupt closure of the main pipeline. The method of characteristics is used to solve the transitory flow as described by Chaudhry in “Applied Hydraulic Transients” (2014) and “Boundary Conditions for Analysis of Waterhammer” (1968).
